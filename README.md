# Interview ELK
One of our SRE team members is attempting to create an ELK stack with docker-compose, they're off to a good start but may need some help.

Your task is to login to the ec2 instance with the credentials provided to you, clone this repo to the instance, and get the stack up and running. There may be some "issues" along the way so please show us your troubleshooting skills by sharing your screen.
